Additional Resources
1. Design Top K heavy hitter problem with log aggregation and low latency requirements.
2. Then he dived into a System design question which was about creating a file storage service. The requirements were a bit simple as he didn't needed me to handle conflicts.
3. flight booking system
4. I had to design a system for managing and retrieving the flight prices from different providers. The design was not too complex but then he started of with scenario based questions again and added a few more requirements/constraints in terms of rate limiting based on different provider limits and challenges faced in a distributed DC enviornment. He also gave me a few problems to solve that they had encountered in Agoda before.
5. Design Reconcialiation system of a Car dealer showroom
6. Design a music streaming application which fetches top trending sonds. I was asked for followups like finding trending songs based on regions and questions on scalability and fault tolerance like how to handle millions of requests from the clients. Interviewer asked to design the data schema of the same and asked for the choices of DB to use. This was more like a casual discussion with the interviewer. Interviewer was very engaging with my thoughts and behaved friendly.
7. Questions on concurrency control and thread safety. Interviewer was keen to know my thought process on creating an api without using inbuild java functions. Used AtomicLong class in java and did some hands on with the code. It went OK-OK, not so good not bad either.
8. The interviewer started with a healthy discussion about current experience/work ,tech stacks
	and basics on elastic search , kibana,grafana etc
9. he asked to design DB for multilingual website
10. a RESTful service for the hotel reservation system (How to stop double bookings)
11. Caching and techniquesss, Strong vs. Eventual Consistency
12. Create a rate limiter for various APIS, including mobile, web, and APIS(Discussed Signature Databases and ML Based algorithms)
13. Create a rate limiter for various APIS, including mobile, web, and APIS(Discussed Signature Databases and ML Based algorithms)
14. Rest API design pattern
15. Discussion Questions : Caching, Microservices, pagination, auto scaling, CI/CD.
16. Asked me to design bill splitting app
17. Syetem desgin problem - Api Rate Limiter
18. Design HashMap without using built-in hash table/hash set data structures/functions
19. Design Distributed Key Value Data Store.
20. Design LRU Cache
21. Design thread safe hashmap
