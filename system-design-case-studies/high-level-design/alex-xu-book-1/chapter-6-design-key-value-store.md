### Step-1: understand the problem and establish the design scope
- do we need to design key value store for specific types of system? or do we need to design in general sense?
	- general
- in terms of requirement, we are supposed to support two functionalities
	- put(key, value)
	- get(key)
- we are supposed to have different types in the value, right?
	- string, int, set
- what is the scale of the system? will the system work in distributed environment?
	- yes
- how many requests per second do we expect?
	- 10M
- what is the expected read / write ratio? can we expect like 80-20 rule?
	- yes
- what is the avg size of the value?
	- 10KB
- system should be highly scalable?
	- yes
- system should be highly available?
	- yes
- low latency?
	- yes
- consistency can be tunable, right?
	- yes
